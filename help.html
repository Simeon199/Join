          Welcome to the help page for <span class="blue-color">Join</span>, your guide to using our
          kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what
          <span class="blue-color">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Join?</h2>

        <p>
          <span class="blue-color">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed
          and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at
          the Developer Akademie. <br /><br />
          Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize
          work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
          <span class="blue-color">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users
          manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface. <br /><br />
          It is important to note that <span class="blue-color">Join</span> is designed as an
          educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to
          ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability,
          reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding
          <span class="blue-color">Join</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>How to use it</h2>

        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="blue-color">Join</span>:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <div>
              <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
              <p>
                When you log in to <span class="blue-color">Join</span>, you'll find a default
                board. This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
                "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <div>
              <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
              <p>
                In <span class="blue-color">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
                required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can
                interact with the tasks on the board.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <div>
              <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
              <p>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new
                card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date,
                assignees, etc.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <div>
              <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
              <p>
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <div>
              <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
              <p>
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
                when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
                <br /><br />

                consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current
                state of your project. <br /><br />
